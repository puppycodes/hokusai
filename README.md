# hokusai

A modern static site generator for building extremely fast websites

*Note: This project is a work in progress and API stability has not yet been reached*

## Design goals

- Produce the fastest possible static websites using the latest and greatest technologies and best practices
- Intuitive, tailored experience for building static websites with Markdown, JSX, and ES2015 that makes the underlying tooling and frameworks invisible
- Minimal configuration, just focus on your content

Under the hood, Hokusai is powered by these fantastic tools:
- [Webpack 2](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
- [Inferno](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno)
- [Styletron](https://github.com/rtsao/styletron)
- [Remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark)

### Usage

Docs are coming soon, probably once [#5](https://github.com/rtsao/hokusai/issues/5) is resolved and a more stable API is achieved.

In the meantime, I'm using Hokusai to build my [my personal website and blog](https://ryantsao.com) so [its source code](https://github.com/rtsao/www) should serve as a good usage example.
